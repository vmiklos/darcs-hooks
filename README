= Hooks for Darcs
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@vmiklos.hu>

== What's darcs-hooks?

darcs-hooks is a framework for link:http://darcs.net/[darcs] hooks. you
can write plugins for it, configure them and each plugin will be invoked
once for each pushed patch.

== Why is it good?

The posthook feature of darcs allows you to run 'one' command 'once'
when you push something to the repo. darcs-hooks allows you to run
'several' commands 'for each pushed patch', no matter if you pushed one or
several ones.

Currently darcs-hooks contains a link:http://cia.vc/[CIA] notifier
plugin, a mail sender plugin and a plugin for
link:http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/pacman-tools/[Frugalware's
syncpkgd].

== How does it work?

All you need is to append the following two lines to your
`_darcs/prefs/defaults` file inside your repository:

----
apply posthook python /path/to/darcs-hooks/darcs-hooks.py
apply run-posthook
----

See the `/config.py` file to enable/disable plugins. See the
`/foo/config.py` files to fine-tune a given plugin.

== Download

----
darcs get http://vmiklos.hu/project/darcs-hooks
----

should be able to download the code.

Enjoy!
